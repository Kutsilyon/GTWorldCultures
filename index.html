    <h2>Basic Info for HTML</h2>

    <p> There are many things in HTML code. HTML code uses things call tags which need to begin in < and end in >. Those are called angle brackets.<br>
 So for example, a basic tag will look like this < h1 > <br> (just don't put any spaces between the angle brackets). There is a slash there since that tag is used for making a
title for your webpage so it needs a slash to tell the computer to end the text here so the code won't be in the actual webpage.</p>
 
    <h2>Here are some basic tags</h2>
    <ul>
	<li> < h1 > to < h6 > * </li>
	<li> < p > * </li>
	<li> < br > </li>
	<li> < strong > * </li>
	<li> < em > * </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="important"> *-ends with a slash</h4>

    <h2> Descriptions of tags </h2>
    <h3> < h1 > to < h6 > </h3>
	<p> < h1 >, < h2 >, < h3 >, < h4 >, < h5 >, and < h6 > stand for heading and are like the titles of the webpage and show what is the most important on the page. <br>
<em>"Welcome to a really bad looking website" used h1 and "Basic Info for HTML" used h2. </em> </p>
    <h3> < p > </h3>
	<p> < p > stands for paragraph and is used for writing a paragraph so instead of using < h5 > and < h6 >, use < p > <br>
<em> This paragraph was used by using the p tag </em> </p>
    <h3> < br > </h3> 
	<p> < br > stands for break and it's used when you want to skip to the next line.<br> <em> like <br> this <br> </em>
    <h3> < strong > </h3>
	<p> < strong > is used to bold things and make them important <br>
<strong> like this. </strong> </p>
    <h3> < em > </h3>
	<p> < em > is used when you want to make things iltalic or emphasize it. <br>
<em> like this </em>
<h4> Always make sure you are using a slash to end a tag that needs it because while doing this, I didn't realize I was randomly bolding things because I put < h3 > instead of < /h3 > </h4>
